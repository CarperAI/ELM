Plant-based foods are a great source of healthy micronutrients, and can play a significant role in providing you with macronutrients also. I would highly recommend including many different foods such as vegetables and pulses in your regular diet.
Vegetables taste quite bad, and I don't like eating them. I would much prefer eating meat and ice cream.
I do not have an opinion on eating vegetables and other plant-based foods. I know that some people prefer a vegetarian or vegan diet, and others prefer eating meaty diets.
