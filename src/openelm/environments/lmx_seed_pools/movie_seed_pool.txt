Die Hard is a brilliant movie - especially one to watch during Christmas. The action scenes are breathtaking, and the characters are satisfying to follow. Highly recommend watching it!
John McClane is the main character in the movie Die Hard. It is based in New York. It is OK. Stereotypical Hollywood movie.
I absolutely hate the violence and explosions in Die Hard. Why are all the characters in the movie (good and bad) crazy? I don't think John McClane is a good character in the film.
If you like action movies, Die Hard does the job. Personally, I think they need to slow down a bit with some of the tense scenes, but the movie was a fun watch.
I found the movie to be a bit boring - I almost fell asleep in the first scene when Hans was in a call with John McClane. Not the worst action movie out there.
